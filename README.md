# Feed Reader Testing

This project features a simple feed reader webpage and is used to demonstrate how to write unit tests in [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) - behaviour-driven Javascript unit test framework. The unit tests were written as part of Udacity Frontend Developer Nanodegree course project.

## About the project

This project is one of the Javascript projects developed as a requirement to acquire the Udacity Frontend Development Nanodegree. The assignment was to write unit tests to cover the existing functionality for the Feed Reader webpage.
The unit tests code is in the file `jasmine/spec/feedreader.js`.

## Why this Project?

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.

## How to run the unit tests

Just open the file `index.html` inside the web browser and the unit tests will run automatically. The test results will be shown at the bottom of the page in the _Jasmine_ section.
